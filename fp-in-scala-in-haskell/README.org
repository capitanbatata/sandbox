* Functional programming in Scala in Haskell

Some exercises from the book [[https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala][Functional Programming in Scala]] implemented in
Haskell.

*** Generating html with pandoc
    If an html document is desired out of the literate-haskell source it is
    possible to run:
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    pandoc -s -f markdown+lhs -t html src/ChapterXX/YY.lhs -o YY.html
    #+END_SRC
    Maybe I will implement a better way to generate documentation for the whole
    chapters using a tool like [[https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/index.html][Hakyll]].
