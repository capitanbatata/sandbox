* Intro
  Consider the identity function:
  #+BEGIN_SRC haskell
  id :: a -> a
  id x = x
  #+END_SRC
  The first thing to notice is that *the function is fully determined by its
  type!*. It *must* be the identity function.
  
  The identity function is actually describing a *family* of functions:
  #+BEGIN_SRC haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE RankNTypes #-}

  id :: forall a. a -> a
  id x = x
  #+END_SRC
* The N in the rank
  The more deeply nested the ~forall~ keyword is, the higher the rank. For
  instance, the following function is rank 2 polymorphic:
  #+BEGIN_SRC haskell
  someInt :: (forall a. a -> a) -> Integer
  #+END_SRC

  And this is rank 3, since the quantifier is in the third level of necessary
  parenthesis.
  #+BEGIN_SRC haskell
  someOtherInt :: ((forall a. a -> a) -> Integer) -> Integer
  #+END_SRC
* Example: Random numbers
