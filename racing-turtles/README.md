# Racing Turtles

An example on
using [Turtle](https://github.com/Gabriel439/Haskell-Turtle-Library) in
combination with [Async](https://github.com/simonmar/async) to run external
process and cancel them. For more information
see
[this issue](https://github.com/Gabriel439/Haskell-Turtle-Library/issues/103).

To run the tests make sure you have the Java runtime and a Java compiler. Then
compile the examples by running (from this directory):

```sh
javac src/SayHi
```

Then run the tests using stack:
```sh
stack test
```
