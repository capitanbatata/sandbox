* About
  Monadic counter implementation in Scala, using Cats. 
* Observations:
  - IntelliJ will spot errors that apparently are not.
  - Syntax of ~for~ is awkward as compared to Haskell's ~do~ notation.
  - A lot of noise in the code (see the definition I had to make of ~local~)
  - $DEITY forbids you fail to bring and implicit definition... but where to
    look for them?
