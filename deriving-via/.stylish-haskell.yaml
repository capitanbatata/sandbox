# The stylish-haskell tool is mainly configured by specifying steps. These steps
# are a list, so they have an order, and one specific step may appear more than
# once (if needed). Each file is processed by these steps in the given order.
steps:

  # Import cleanup
  - imports:  
      # The following options affect only import list alignment.
      #
      # List align has following options:
      #
      # - after_alias: Import list is aligned with end of import including
      #   'as' and 'hiding' keywords.
      #
      #   > import qualified Data.List      as List (concat, foldl, foldr, head,
      #   >                                          init, last, length)
      #
      # - with_alias: Import list is aligned with start of alias or hiding.
      #
      #   > import qualified Data.List      as List (concat, foldl, foldr, head,
      #   >                                 init, last, length)
      #
      # - new_line: Import list starts always on new line.
      #
      #   > import qualified Data.List      as List
      #   >     (concat, foldl, foldr, head, init, last, length)
      #
      # Default: after_alias
      list_align: new_line  

      # List padding determines indentation of import list on lines after import.
      # This option affects 'long_list_align'.
      #
      # - <integer>: constant value
      #
      # - module_name: align under start of module name.
      #   Useful for 'file' and 'group' align settings.
      list_padding: 2
