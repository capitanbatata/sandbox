* The expression problem

  - It is about defining new interpreters for existing terms, and extending the
    interpreters for handling an enriched language.
  - The tagless final approach seems to make it easier to add new data
    variants.
  - There is a simple example (page 7) that adds a ~mul~ operation to ~MulSym~.

* The de-serialization problem

  - Communicating terms between computers, or storing them for further
    processing.
  - Writing an extensive de-serializer.
  - ~fromTree :: ExpSYM repr => Tree -> Ether ErrMsg repr~
  - Ok, we can write this function, no problem.But ... what if we want to
    interpret the de-serialized times many times, with many different
    interpreters?
